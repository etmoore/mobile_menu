//Problem: It looks bad in smaller browser widths and small devices
//Solution: Hide the text links and sway them out with a more appropriate navigation

//Create a select and append to menu
//Cycle over menu links
  //create an option
  //option's value is the href
  //option's text is the text of links
  //append option to select
//Create button
//Bind click to button
  //Go to select's location
//Modify CSS to hide links on small width and show button and select
  //Also hides select and button on larger width and show links
//Deal with selected options depending on current page
